  - I see several entrepreneurs as my current role models, first and foremost Sir Richard Branson, Andriy Fedoriv and Mykhailo Katsurin. If you're not Ukrainian, then you probably have never heard of the latter two gentlemen, but you still can guess where the story goes. I am fascinated by entrepreneurship, even though I haven't built my own business yet. I tried a few times and failed pretty fast (which is not a bad thing). Learned a lot, and will be back with a better ideaðŸ˜‰
  - So far, investing has worked better for me. It feels like baby steps until now, but quite successful baby steps nonetheless. I'm interested in real estate, crypto and private equity.
