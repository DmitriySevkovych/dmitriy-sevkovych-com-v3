  - It is safe to say that I like to move my body. 
  - Back in the day I have spent over 15 years playing and coaching basketball. It was a successful career, and it sure as hell was a formative experience. Workouts, achievements, friendships, fun. And at the same time failures, injuries, surgeries, rehabs. So many life lessons and just a crazy rollercoaster ride...
  - After the wear and tear of basketball I needed to do something where I would not risk getting hurt all the time. I tried boxing, an obvious choiceðŸ˜‚ I loved it, and I actually never got hurt! Well, maybe apart from a bloody nose on very few occasions, but that doesn't even count. Nowadays I live a bit too far from a boxing club, so I don't box at the moment. But one day I'll be backðŸ˜‰
  - To keep myself in shape, I have recently started dipping my toes into calisthenics. I'm definitely not a natural, being rather tall and heavy. But let's see how far this journey takes meðŸ˜‰
