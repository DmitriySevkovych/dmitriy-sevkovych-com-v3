title: Where I'm from

description: 
  - I am originally from Kyiv, Ukraine. Born in 1991, I remember a really weird, nonsensical and yet loveable post-Soviet country growing up. Then my family moved to Stuttgart, Germany when I was 9. I live not far away from Stuttgart to this day. And Ukraine has come a long, long way since thenðŸ˜‰
  - I love Germany, that's for sure. But the childhood memories, my wife (who is also from Kyiv) and the great people of Ukraine definitely make my heart beat yellow and blue. Ð¡Ð»Ð°Ð²Ð° Ð£ÐºÑ€Ð°Ñ—Ð½Ñ–!
