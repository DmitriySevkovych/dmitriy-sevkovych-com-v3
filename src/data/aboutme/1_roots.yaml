description: 
  - I am originally from Kyiv, Ukraine. However, my family moved to Stuttgart, Germany when I was 9. I live not far away from Stuttgart to this day.
  - I love Germany, that's for sure. But the childhood memories, my wife (who is also from Kyiv) and the great people of Ukraine definitely make my heart beat yellow and blue.
