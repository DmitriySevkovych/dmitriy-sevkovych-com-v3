description: 
  - In the beginning of the 2010s I studied theoretical mathematics. But the bills needed to be paid, so I side-hustled as a basketball coach, a high-school tutor and as a software developer. 
  - The IT stuff stuck. After finishing my M.Sc. I worked as a full-time employee for a few years and in early 2019 embarked on my freelancing journey.
  - Now I work in web development, machine learning and cloud infrastructure.
