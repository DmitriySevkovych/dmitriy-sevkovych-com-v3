  - I probably have too many hobbies. And right now I don't even count in sports, because that's a passion, not a hobby! However, some hobbies I take very, very seriouslyðŸ˜‰
  - I used to brew my own beer. We gathered with friends and made some really good beers (along with some OK-ish and some awful ones, but most turned out really tasty). However, my wife gave up drinking alcohol due to health issues, and I decided to follow suit. Brewing beer suddenly became less fun, but I replaced it with baking bread. Now we specialize in baking absolutely delicious, gluten-free sourdough breads.
  - And last but not least... I absolutely love cofee!!! I'm a huge fan of the "third wave" specialty coffee movement, I dream about creating my own roastery one day, and I oftentimes call myself a self-taught wannabe barista. If you happen to be in Stuttgart, feel free to pop in for a coffee and a chatðŸ˜‰
