Takeaways from _Fedoriv_ on how to approach a 60 seconds pitch

-   relax and enjoy yourself. Be prepared in what you want to bring across, but don't learn a monologue by heart.
-   give compelling numbers. Numbers are sexy for an investor (if the calculations are clear and correct).
-   focus on your core advantage/differentiator. Repeat it multiple times.
